# Entrectinib hit to lead

0) HTS -> 3-amino-5-substituted indazole --> Binds to hinge region

1) Aliphatic rings containing nitrogen, oxygen, or hydroxyl groups would rotate perpendicular to the plane filling the ATP sugar pocket and displacing a water. Nitrogen - oxigen hbond locks conformation

2) Steoreochemistry was avioided as separating the enantiomers was not scalable

3) Solubility was no good, so a solubilizing pyrazine was placed at the tail of the molecule

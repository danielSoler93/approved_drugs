# Daurismo's head to lead

0) Benzimidazoles serie but had poor metabolic stability, high plasma protein binging and poor aqueous solubility due to high lipophilicity cLOGD = 4.48

1) Change from phenil to ciclohexane, decreases the lipophilicit making it more metabolicly stable. However, still had poor oral bioavailability due to poor solubility

2) Change the cyclohexane to a 2-mthylamine cyclo hexane to improve solubility

3) p-cyano urea to improve potency and keep the best overall combination of properties. (No CYP interaction, bioavailability, half-life 30h, good solubility...)
